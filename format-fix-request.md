I would like to fix the format of the chat response. In the console it correctly show as:

New text: Hello! I'm ready to assist you with your calendar.

Based on the provided data, I can see you have the following event today:

*   **test4** from 8:30 PM to 9:30 PM

How can I help you with your schedule today? For example, would you like me to:

*   Check your availability?
*   Find a specific event?
*   Show your upcoming meetings?

But in the chat interface it show as :

I should render new lines and tabs correctly. And I would also like it to render markdown.
