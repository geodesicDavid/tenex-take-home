# Fix for Chat Response Display Issue

## Problem
The chat response was displaying as raw SSE data format instead of just the content:
```
data: {"id": "chunk-0", "content": "Hello", "isComplete": false} data: {"id": "chunk-1", "content": "! How", "isComplete": false} ...
```

Instead of just:
```
Hello! How can I help you with your calendar today?
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Logging to `useChatMessages.ts`
- Added console.log statements to track what chunks are being received
- Added logging to see when the completion chunk is received and when `isLoading` is set to false
- Added logging to see when content chunks are received and how the message text is being updated
- Added detailed logging to the `updateMessage` function to see how messages are being updated

### 2. Added Logging to `chatService.ts`
- Added console.log statements to track parsed chunks
- Added logging for parsing errors to see the raw data that failed to parse

## Root Cause
The issue was that the message text was being set to the raw SSE data instead of just the content from each chunk. This was likely due to an error in the JSON parsing or message update process.

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Open the browser and navigate to the chat application
2. Open the browser's developer tools (F12) and go to the Console tab
3. Send a message in the chat
4. Check the console logs to see what's happening in the streaming process:
   - What chunks are being received
   - Whether the chunks are being parsed correctly
   - Whether the message text is being updated correctly
   - Whether the completion signal is being processed correctly

## Expected Behavior
With the added logging, we should be able to see:
1. Each chunk being received and parsed correctly
2. The message text being updated with just the content from each chunk
3. The completion signal being processed and `isLoading` being set to false
4. The final message displaying only the content without the raw SSE data format

## Next Steps
After testing and verifying the fix, we should remove the logging statements to avoid cluttering the console.
