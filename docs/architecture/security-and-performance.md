# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**

- **CSP Headers:** A strict Content Security Policy will be implemented to prevent XSS attacks.
- **XSS Prevention:** React's default JSX escaping will be relied upon to prevent XSS.
- **Secure Storage:** No sensitive information will be stored in the browser's local storage.

**Backend Security:**

- **Input Validation:** FastAPI's Pydantic models will be used to validate all incoming request data.
- **Rate Limiting:** Vercel's built-in rate limiting will be used to prevent abuse.
- **CORS Policy:** A strict CORS policy will be configured to only allow requests from the frontend application.

**Authentication Security:**

- **Token Storage:** Refresh tokens will be securely stored in Google Cloud Secret Manager. Access tokens will be stored in a secure, HTTP-only cookie.
- **Session Management:** Server-side sessions will be used to manage user authentication.
- **Password Policy:** Not applicable, as we are using Google OAuth.

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**

- **Bundle Size Target:** The initial bundle size will be kept under 500KB.
- **Loading Strategy:** Code splitting will be used to only load the necessary JavaScript for each page.
- **Caching Strategy:** Vercel's CDN will be used to cache static assets.

**Backend Performance:**

- **Response Time Target:** The average API response time will be under 200ms (excluding external API calls).
- **Database Optimization:** Not applicable.
- **Caching Strategy:** Not applicable for the MVP.
