# Introduction
This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for cal agent, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

## Starter Template or Existing Project
N/A - Greenfield project. The technology stack and monorepo structure are defined in the PRD.
