# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary

- **Overall PRD Completeness:** 95%
- **MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right
- **Readiness for Architecture Phase:** Ready
- **Most Critical Gaps or Concerns:** The PRD is very strong. The only minor gap is the lack of explicit definition around data handling (retention, privacy), which is low-risk for an MVP of this nature but should be noted.

## Top Issues by Priority

- **LOW:** **Data Policy Definition:** The PRD does not explicitly state the data retention policy (e.g., "user data is ephemeral and not stored long-term") or a formal privacy policy. For a demo project, this is not a blocker, but in a production scenario, it would be a high-priority item.

## MVP Scope Assessment

The MVP scope is well-defined and appropriate. It focuses on the core value proposition—demonstrating technical skill through a functional AI agent—while correctly deferring non-essential features like write access, multi-provider support, and advanced analytics. The breakdown into three epics is logical and provides a clear, achievable path to completion.

## Technical Readiness

The PRD provides clear technical constraints and guidance. The technology stack is defined, the architecture is straightforward, and key risks (like OAuth security) have been identified with mitigation strategies. The document gives a clear mandate to the Architect.

## Recommendations

No major revisions are required. I recommend adding a small section under "Non-Functional Requirements" to explicitly state:

- "**NFR9: Data Privacy & Retention:** All user calendar data is handled ephemerally for the duration of the session and is not stored or logged long-term. The application will not use user data for any purpose other than providing the core chat functionality."

This small addition would move the "Cross-Functional Requirements" category to a PASS.

## Final Decision

**READY FOR ARCHITECT:** The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for the architectural design phase.
