# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The UI should be clean, professional, and visually appealing, leveraging a well-established design system (Material-UI) to signal a high standard of quality. The design's primary focus is to spotlight the core technical demonstration: the chat interaction with the user's calendar data. To that end, the application must clearly communicate its state at all times—especially during loading, authentication, and API interactions—to manage user expectations and demonstrate robustness.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

The core interaction is a single-page application experience after login. The main screen features a two-column layout on desktop (calendar on the left, chat on the right) that stacks vertically on smaller screens. The chat interface is the primary method of user interaction.

## Core Screens and Views

*   **Login Screen:** A simple page with a single "Login with Google" call to action.
*   **Main Application Screen:** The main interface containing two primary components:
    *   **Calendar View:** A read-only display of the user's calendar.
    *   **Chat Interface:** The chat history and text input for interacting with the agent.

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The application will adhere to **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards to ensure it is accessible to users with disabilities, demonstrating a commitment to high-quality, inclusive development.

## Branding

A simple and clean aesthetic will be maintained, consistent with Material-UI's design principles. The focus is on a professional, polished look rather than custom branding.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The application will be a responsive web app, ensuring a seamless experience across modern desktop web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and mobile/tablet devices.
