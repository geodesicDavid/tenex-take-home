# Requirements

## Functional

1.  **FR1:** A user can securely authenticate their Google/GSuite account using the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
2.  **FR2:** The backend must securely store and manage refresh tokens for continued access to the Google Calendar API.
3.  **FR3:** The application will pull and display calendar event data from the user's Google Calendar.
4.  **FR4:** The application will provide a clean, functional web interface built with React that includes a calendar view and a chat window.
5.  **FR5:** The backend will take natural language input from the chat interface, use the user's calendar data to provide context, and pass it to a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate relevant, helpful text-based responses.
6.  **FR6:** For the MVP, the agent will only have read-only access to calendar data; it will not create, modify, or delete calendar events.
7.  **FR7:** The MVP will exclusively support Google Calendar and will not integrate with other providers like Outlook or iCloud.
8.  **FR8:** The application is designed for single-user demonstration purposes and will not support multi-user accounts or collaborative features.

## Non-Functional

1.  **NFR1:** The project must be developed with a minimal budget, relying on free tiers for hosting (e.g., Vercel, Heroku) and API services (Google Cloud, Google Gemini).
2.  **NFR2:** The user interface must be fast and responsive, with interaction responses feeling instantaneous (<100ms).
3.  **NFR3:** All API interactions (calendar fetching, LLM responses) must feel quick, with clear loading states to manage user expectations.
4.  **NFR4:** All client-server communication must be secured over HTTPS.
5.  **NFR5:** The final application must be 100% functional and deployed to a publicly accessible URL.
6.  **NFR6:** The complete source code must be available in a clean, well-documented GitHub repository.
7.  **NFR7:** The application must meet web accessibility standards, targeting WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
8.  **NFR8:** The application's layout must be responsive, adapting seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
