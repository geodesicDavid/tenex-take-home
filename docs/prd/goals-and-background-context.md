# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

*   Secure a desirable software engineering position by effectively showcasing technical abilities.
*   Receive interview requests and job offers where this project is a positive contributing factor.
*   Serve as a key talking point to facilitate deep technical discussions during interviews.
*   Demonstrate expertise in building AI-powered applications, integrating with external APIs (like Google Calendar), and orchestrating large language models (LLMs).

## Background Context

A resume and interview alone are often insufficient to effectively demonstrate practical, hands-on expertise with modern technologies. This project, the "cal agent," addresses this by serving as a tangible, interactive demonstration of the author's ability to architect and build a functional, full-stack application that integrates complex services. It is a web-based tool that allows a user to interact with their Google Calendar via a chat interface, providing concrete, verifiable proof of skills in AI integration and API orchestration, bridging the gap between a resume and real-world capability.
