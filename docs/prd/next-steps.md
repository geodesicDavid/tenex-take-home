# Next Steps

This PRD is now considered complete and ready for the next phase of the project.

## UX Expert Prompt

"Sally, please review the `docs/prd.md` and create a `front-end-spec.md` that translates the product vision into a detailed specification for the user interface, covering user flows, wireframes, and a component-based design system approach using Material-UI."

## Architect Prompt

"Winston, please review the `docs/prd.md` and create a `fullstack-architecture.md` document. Your architecture should detail the frontend and backend service design, data flows, API contracts, and the plan for secure integration with Google's OAuth and Gemini APIs, based on the requirements and technical assumptions outlined in the PRD."
