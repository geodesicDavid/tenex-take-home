# Story 2.2: Frontend Main Application Layout

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see a well-structured main application screen with both a calendar view and a chat interface,
**so that** I can easily understand and interact with the application's core features.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The placeholder main application page is replaced with a two-column layout using Material-UI's grid system.
2. The left column is clearly designated for the calendar view.
3. The right column is clearly designated for the chat interface.
4. The layout is fully responsive, stacking the two columns vertically on smaller (mobile/tablet) screens.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Replace placeholder layout with Material-UI Grid system (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Update `MainAppPage` component to use Material-UI Grid container
  - [ ] Implement two-column layout using Grid items
  - [ ] Add proper spacing and styling to the layout
- [ ] Designate left column for calendar view (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create `CalendarContainer` component for calendar area
  - [ ] Add placeholder content and styling for calendar section
  - [ ] Configure column to take appropriate width (e.g., 6-8 columns on desktop)
- [ ] Designate right column for chat interface (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create `ChatContainer` component for chat area
  - [ ] Add placeholder content and styling for chat section
  - [ ] Configure column to take appropriate width (e.g., 4-6 columns on desktop)
- [ ] Implement responsive design (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Add Material-UI responsive breakpoints (sm, md, lg)
  - [ ] Configure layout to stack vertically on mobile/tablet screens
  - [ ] Test responsiveness across different screen sizes
  - [ ] Add proper padding and margins for different breakpoints

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.3 (Frontend Login Interface) must be completed first as it creates the placeholder `MainAppPage` component that this story will enhance. The existing basic two-column layout structure will be replaced with a proper Material-UI Grid implementation. [Source: docs/stories/1.3.frontend-login-interface.story.md]

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this layout story. Will use existing User and authentication state from Story 1.3. [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

### API Specifications
No new API endpoints required for this story. Will use existing authentication state management from Story 1.3. [Source: docs/stories/1.3.frontend-login-interface.story.md]

### Component Specifications
MainAppPage Enhancement [Source: docs/stories/1.3.frontend-login-interface.story.md]:
- **Current State**: Basic placeholder two-column layout structure
- **Target State**: Material-UI Grid-based responsive layout
- **New Components**: `CalendarContainer`, `ChatContainer`
- **Technology Stack**: React, Material-UI Grid system

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Main app page: `apps/web/src/pages/MainAppPage.tsx` (enhance existing)
- Calendar container: `apps/web/src/components/layout/CalendarContainer.tsx`
- Chat container: `apps/web/src/components/layout/ChatContainer.tsx`
- Layout styles: `apps/web/src/styles/layout.ts`
- Shared types: `packages/shared/src/layout.ts` (if needed)

### Testing Requirements
Based on testing strategy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Frontend-Tests]:
- Test file location: `apps/web/src/__tests__/`
- Test frameworks: Jest & React Testing Library
- Required tests:
  - Layout component rendering tests
  - Responsive behavior tests across breakpoints
  - Grid system configuration tests
  - Component integration tests
  - Accessibility tests for responsive layout

### Technical Constraints
- Must use React 18.x with TypeScript [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Must use Material-UI 5.x for components and Grid system [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Must implement responsive design with proper breakpoints [Source: epic requirements]
- Must follow existing component organization patterns [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Component-Organization]
- Component naming must follow PascalCase convention [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Naming-Conventions]
- Must use Material-UI's responsive Grid system (Grid, Grid item components)

## Testing
- Test file location: `apps/web/src/__tests__/`
- Test standards: Follow frontend testing patterns with Jest & React Testing Library
- Testing frameworks: Jest & React Testing Library
- Specific requirements:
  - Test layout rendering at different breakpoints
  - Test Grid container and item configuration
  - Test responsive stacking behavior
  - Test component integration and styling
  - Test accessibility of responsive layout
