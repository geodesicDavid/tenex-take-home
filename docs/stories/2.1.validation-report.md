## Category Details

### 1. Goal & Context Clarity ✅
- [x] Story goal/purpose is clearly stated
- [x] Relationship to epic goals is evident  
- [x] How the story fits into overall system flow is explained
- [x] Dependencies on previous stories are identified (Stories 1.1 & 1.2)
- [x] Business context and value are clear

### 2. Technical Implementation Guidance ✅
- [x] Key files to create/modify are identified (calendar.py, calendar_service.py, calendar models)
- [x] Technologies specifically needed are mentioned (FastAPI, Google Calendar API)
- [x] Critical APIs or interfaces are sufficiently described (/api/calendar/events, Google Calendar API)
- [x] Necessary data models or structures are referenced (CalendarEvent interface)
- [x] Required environment variables are identified (Google API credentials)
- [x] Any exceptions to standard coding patterns are noted (token refresh, authentication middleware)

### 3. Reference Effectiveness ✅
- [x] References to external documents point to specific relevant sections
- [x] Critical information from previous stories is summarized (dependencies on Stories 1.1 & 1.2)
- [x] Context is provided for why references are relevant
- [x] References use consistent format (e.g., `architecture/components.md#Backend-CalendarService`)

### 4. Self-Containment Assessment ✅
- [x] Core information needed is included (not overly reliant on external docs)
- [x] Implicit assumptions are made explicit (dependencies on authentication system)
- [x] Domain-specific terms or concepts are explained (OAuth token refresh, Google Calendar API)
- [x] Edge cases or error scenarios are addressed (token expiration, API rate limits)

### 5. Testing Guidance ✅
- [x] Required testing approach is outlined
- [x] Key test scenarios are identified (authentication, token refresh, API integration)
- [x] Success criteria are defined
- [x] Special testing considerations are noted (mocking Google Calendar API)

## Final Assessment
**READY**: The story provides sufficient context for implementation

## Developer Perspective
**Could you implement this story as written?** Yes

**What questions would you have?** None - the story provides comprehensive API integration guidance

**What might cause delays or rework?** 
- Dependency on Stories 1.1 & 1.2 completion
- Google Cloud Secret Manager configuration
- Google Calendar API quota and rate limits
- These are well-documented and should be manageable

## Strengths
- Clear dependencies on authentication stories are explicitly stated
- Comprehensive Google Calendar API integration details
- Proper security considerations (protected endpoints, token refresh)
- Detailed testing requirements with mocking strategies
- Clear data transformation and validation requirements
- Error handling for API failures and rate limits

## No Critical Issues Found
The story is well-prepared and ready for developer implementation once Stories 1.1 & 1.2 are complete.
