# Story 3.3a: Local Development Setup & Documentation

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer comfortable with GitHub and command line,
**I want** to easily set up and run the application locally from the GitHub repository,
**so that** I can test, develop, and understand the codebase without needing production deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A comprehensive README.md exists at the project root with clear setup instructions.
2. Local development setup works with standard commands (npm install, turbo dev, etc.).
3. All required environment variables are documented with examples.
4. Both frontend and backend start successfully locally on standard ports.
5. Complete end-to-end workflow (Login → View Calendar → Chat → Get AI Response) works locally.

### Previous Story Insights

This story builds upon all previous stories being complete:

- Story 3.2 (Frontend Chat Response Handling) provides the complete chat interface

### Local Development Architecture

Local development setup [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]:

```
Developer Machine
├── Frontend (React/Vite) → localhost:3000
├── Backend (FastAPI) → localhost:8000
├── API Endpoints → localhost:8000/api
└── External Services
    ├── Google OAuth (for authentication)
    ├── Google Calendar API (for data)
    └── Google Gemini API (for AI responses)
```

### Environment Configuration

Local development environment variables [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]:

```bash
# Frontend (.env in apps/web)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-local-dev-client-id
VITE_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Backend (.env in apps/api)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-local-dev-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-local-dev-client-secret
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/api/auth/google/callback
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
SECRET_KEY=a-very-secret-key-for-local-dev
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Technical Specifications

Local development tools and configuration [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:

- **Frontend Dev Server:** Vite with hot-reload
- **Backend Dev Server:** FastAPI/Uvicorn with auto-reload
- **Monorepo Tool:** Turborepo for orchestration
- **Package Manager:** npm or yarn
- **Development Environment:** Local machine with Node.js 18+ and Python 3.11+
- **Local Ports:** Frontend (3000), Backend (8000)
- **Hot Reload:** Enabled for both frontend and backend
- **Development CORS:** Permissive local development settings

### File Locations

Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

- Project README: `README.md` (new/updated)
- Frontend dev config: `apps/web/vite.config.ts`
- Backend dev config: `apps/api/` (FastAPI settings)
- Environment examples: `apps/web/.env.example`, `apps/api/.env.example`
- Local development scripts: `package.json` (turbo commands)
- Development documentation: `docs/development/` (enhanced)

### Testing Requirements

Based on testing strategy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:

- Unit Tests: `apps/web/src/__tests__/`, `apps/api/tests/`
- Integration Tests: `apps/e2e/` (local development environment)
- Required tests:
  - Local development setup validation
  - Environment variable configuration tests
  - Local API endpoint integration tests
  - Frontend-backend communication tests
  - OAuth flow tests with local credentials

### Technical Constraints

- Must support local development with standard tooling [Source: architecture/development-workflow.md]
- Must provide clear documentation for GitHub-based onboarding [Source: NFR6 requirements]
- Must include comprehensive environment variable documentation [Source: security requirements]
- Must ensure local development mirrors production behavior as closely as possible [Source: development best practices]
- Must include troubleshooting guidance for common setup issues [Source: developer experience requirements]

## Testing

- Unit test location: `apps/web/src/__tests__/`, `apps/api/tests/`
- Integration test location: `apps/e2e/`
- Test standards: Follow testing patterns with Jest, React Testing Library, and Pytest
- Specific requirements:
  - Test local development setup procedures
  - Test environment variable configuration
  - Test local API communication
  - Test complete local workflow functionality
  - Test OAuth flow with local development credentials
  - Test hot-reload functionality
  - Test error handling in local environment
