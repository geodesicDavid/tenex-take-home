# Story 2.3: Frontend Calendar Display

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see my upcoming calendar events displayed clearly on the screen,
**so that** I have context for my conversations with the agent.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Upon loading the main application screen, the frontend calls the `/api/calendar/events` endpoint.
2. A loading indicator (e.g., a `CircularProgress` component) is displayed in the calendar view area while the data is being fetched.
3. The fetched calendar events are rendered in the left column in a clear, readable format (e.g., a list of events with times and titles).
4. An appropriate error message is displayed in the calendar view area if the data fails to load.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement calendar data fetching on app load (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create `useCalendarEvents` hook to fetch calendar data
  - [ ] Integrate with existing `getCalendarEvents` service function
  - [ ] Set up data fetching on main app component mount
  - [ ] Handle authentication state for API calls
- [ ] Add loading indicator for calendar data (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Implement loading state management in calendar component
  - [ ] Add Material-UI `CircularProgress` component
  - [ ] Position loading indicator in calendar container
  - [ ] Handle loading state transitions
- [ ] Render calendar events in readable format (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Create `CalendarEventList` component to display events
  - [ ] Implement event item component with time and title display
  - [ ] Add proper styling and formatting for event dates/times
  - [ ] Handle empty state when no events are present
  - [ ] Integrate with existing `CalendarContainer` from Story 2.2
- [ ] Implement error handling for data loading (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Add error state management in calendar component
  - [ ] Create error display component with user-friendly messages
  - [ ] Handle different error types (network, auth, API errors)
  - [ ] Add retry mechanism for failed requests
  - [ ] Log errors appropriately for debugging

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story depends on multiple previous stories:
- Story 1.3 (Frontend Login Interface) provides authentication and routing
- Story 2.1 (Backend Calendar API Endpoint) provides the `/api/calendar/events` endpoint
- Story 2.2 (Frontend Main Application Layout) provides the `CalendarContainer` and layout structure
[Source: docs/stories/1.3.frontend-login-interface.story.md, docs/stories/2.1.backend-calendar-api-endpoint.story.md, docs/stories/2.2.frontend-main-application-layout.story.md]

### Data Models
CalendarEvent model for displaying events [Source: architecture/data-models.md#CalendarEvent]:
```typescript
interface CalendarEvent {
  id: string;           // The unique ID of the event
  summary: string;      // The title of the event
  start: Date;          // The start date and time of the event
  end: Date;            // The end date and time of the event
  description: string | null; // The description of the event
}
```

### API Specifications
Calendar API endpoint [Source: docs/stories/2.1.backend-calendar-api-endpoint.story.md]:
- `GET /api/calendar/events` - Fetches user's calendar events
- Requires authentication via HTTP-only cookies
- Returns structured JSON array of CalendarEvent objects
- Handles token refresh and API errors

Frontend service integration [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#Service-Example]:
```typescript
export const getCalendarEvents = async (): Promise<CalendarEvent[]> => {
  const response = await apiClient.get('/calendar/events');
  return response.data;
};
```

### Component Specifications
Frontend: CalendarComponent [Source: architecture/components.md#Frontend-CalendarComponent]:
- **Responsibility**: Fetches and displays the user's calendar events
- **Key Interfaces**: Renders a calendar view
- **Dependencies**: Backend: CalendarService
- **Technology Stack**: React, Material-UI

Material-UI Components [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]:
- `CircularProgress` for loading indicator
- `List`/`ListItem` for event display
- `Typography` for text formatting
- `Box`/`Paper` for layout and styling

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
- Calendar component: `apps/web/src/components/CalendarComponent.tsx`
- Calendar event list: `apps/web/src/components/CalendarEventList.tsx`
- Calendar event item: `apps/web/src/components/CalendarEventItem.tsx`
- Calendar hook: `apps/web/src/hooks/useCalendarEvents.ts`
- Calendar service: `apps/web/src/services/calendarService.ts`
- Calendar container: `apps/web/src/components/layout/CalendarContainer.tsx` (enhance from Story 2.2)
- Shared types: `packages/shared/src/calendar.ts`

### Testing Requirements
Based on testing strategy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#Frontend-Tests]:
- Test file location: `apps/web/src/__tests__/`
- Test frameworks: Jest & React Testing Library
- Required tests:
  - Calendar data fetching and state management tests
  - Loading state rendering tests
  - Event list rendering and formatting tests
  - Error handling and display tests
  - Component integration tests
  - Service layer integration tests (mocked)

### Technical Constraints
- Must use React 18.x with TypeScript [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Must use Material-UI 5.x for components [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Must use existing API client with credentials [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#API-Client-Setup]
- Must use React hooks for state management [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#State-Management-Patterns]
- Must handle loading, error, and success states [Source: epic requirements]
- Must integrate with existing CalendarContainer from Story 2.2
- Component naming must follow PascalCase convention [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Naming-Conventions]

## Testing
- Test file location: `apps/web/src/__tests__/`
- Test standards: Follow frontend testing patterns with Jest & React Testing Library
- Testing frameworks: Jest & React Testing Library
- Specific requirements:
  - Mock API responses for successful data loading
  - Test loading state rendering with CircularProgress
  - Test error state display and retry mechanisms
  - Test event list rendering and formatting
  - Test component integration with CalendarContainer
  - Test different calendar event scenarios (empty, multiple events, etc.)
