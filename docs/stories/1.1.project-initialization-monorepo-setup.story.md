# Story 1.1: Project Initialization & Monorepo Setup

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to initialize the project within a monorepo structure,
**so that** I can efficiently manage the frontend and backend codebases in a single repository.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A Git repository is created and configured.
2. A monorepo management tool (e.g., Turborepo) is set up at the root of the project.
3. Initial application folders for `frontend` (React/Vite) and `backend` (FastAPI) are created within the monorepo.
4. A shared package is created within the monorepo to hold common TypeScript types that will be used by both the frontend and backend.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Initialize Git repository with proper configuration (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create .gitignore file with appropriate exclusions
  - [x] Set up initial commit with README
- [x] Install and configure Turborepo at root level (AC: 2)
  - [x] Create turbo.json configuration file
  - [x] Set up root package.json with workspaces configuration
- [x] Create frontend application structure (AC: 3)
  - [x] Set up React/Vite app in apps/web directory
  - [x] Configure Vite for TypeScript and Material-UI
  - [x] Create basic folder structure (components, pages, services)
- [x] Create backend application structure (AC: 3)
  - [x] Set up FastAPI app in apps/api directory
  - [x] Create requirements.txt with necessary dependencies
  - [x] Set up basic folder structure (app/main.py, app/api, app/core)
- [x] Create shared types package (AC: 4)
  - [x] Set up packages/shared directory structure
  - [x] Create initial TypeScript types for user authentication
  - [x] Configure package.json for shared package
  - [x] Set up type exports for frontend and backend consumption

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No previous stories - this is the foundational story.

### Data Models

No specific data models required for this story. [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

### API Specifications

No API endpoints required for this story. [Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

### Component Specifications

No UI components required for this story. [Source: architecture/components.md]

### File Locations

Based on the unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:

- Root: `./` (monorepo root)
- Frontend: `apps/web/` (React/Vite application)
- Backend: `apps/api/` (FastAPI application)
- Shared: `packages/shared/` (TypeScript types and utilities)
- Configuration: `turbo.json` (Turborepo configuration)
- Root package: `package.json` (workspaces configuration)

### Testing Requirements

Based on testing strategy [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]:

- Frontend tests: `apps/web/src/__tests__/`
- Backend tests: `apps/api/tests/`
- Shared package tests: `packages/shared/src/__tests__/`
- Test frameworks: Jest & React Testing Library for frontend, Pytest for backend

### Technical Constraints

- Must use Turborepo for monorepo management [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Frontend must use TypeScript with React 18.x and Vite [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Backend must use Python 3.11+ with FastAPI [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Shared types must be defined in packages/shared and imported from there [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

## Testing

- Test file location: `apps/web/src/__tests__/`, `apps/api/tests/`, `packages/shared/src/__tests__/`
- Test standards: Follow Testing Pyramid - Unit > Integration > E2E
- Testing frameworks: Jest & React Testing Library for frontend, Pytest for backend
- Specific requirements: Basic setup verification tests for monorepo structure

### File List

- Root: `package.json`, `turbo.json`
- Frontend: `apps/web/package.json`, `apps/web/vite.config.ts`, `apps/web/tsconfig.json`, `apps/web/src/main.tsx`, `apps/web/src/App.tsx`, `apps/web/src/index.css`
- Backend: `apps/api/package.json`, `apps/api/requirements.txt`, `apps/api/app/main.py`, `apps/api/tests/test_main.py`
- Shared: `packages/shared/package.json`, `packages/shared/tsconfig.json`, `packages/shared/src/types.ts`, `packages/shared/src/index.ts`
