## Category Details

### 1. Goal & Context Clarity ✅
- [x] Story goal/purpose is clearly stated
- [x] Relationship to epic goals is evident  
- [x] How the story fits into overall system flow is explained
- [x] Dependencies on previous stories are identified (Stories 1.3, 2.1, 2.2)
- [x] Business context and value are clear

### 2. Technical Implementation Guidance ✅
- [x] Key files to create/modify are identified (CalendarComponent, CalendarEventList, useCalendarEvents hook)
- [x] Technologies specifically needed are mentioned (React hooks, Material-UI components)
- [x] Critical APIs or interfaces are sufficiently described (/api/calendar/events, service integration)
- [x] Necessary data models or structures are referenced (CalendarEvent interface)
- [x] Required environment variables are identified (API base URL configuration)
- [x] Any exceptions to standard coding patterns are noted (loading/error states, retry mechanisms)

### 3. Reference Effectiveness ✅
- [x] References to external documents point to specific relevant sections
- [x] Critical information from previous stories is summarized (dependencies on multiple stories)
- [x] Context is provided for why references are relevant
- [x] References use consistent format (e.g., `architecture/components.md#Frontend-CalendarComponent`)

### 4. Self-Containment Assessment ✅
- [x] Core information needed is included (not overly reliant on external docs)
- [x] Implicit assumptions are made explicit (integration with CalendarContainer, API authentication)
- [x] Domain-specific terms or concepts are explained (loading states, error handling)
- [x] Edge cases or error scenarios are addressed (network errors, empty states, retry logic)

### 5. Testing Guidance ✅
- [x] Required testing approach is outlined
- [x] Key test scenarios are identified (data fetching, loading states, error handling)
- [x] Success criteria are defined
- [x] Special testing considerations are noted (mocking API responses, component integration)

## Final Assessment
**READY**: The story provides sufficient context for implementation

## Developer Perspective
**Could you implement this story as written?** Yes

**What questions would you have?** None - the story provides comprehensive calendar display implementation guidance

**What might cause delays or rework?** 
- Dependencies on multiple previous stories (1.3, 2.1, 2.2)
- Integration complexity with existing CalendarContainer
- API error handling and retry logic implementation
- These are well-documented and should be manageable

## Strengths
- Clear dependencies on multiple previous stories are explicitly stated
- Comprehensive calendar component implementation details
- Proper state management with loading/error/success states
- Detailed testing requirements with mocking strategies
- Integration with existing architecture patterns
- Material-UI component usage clearly specified
- Error handling and retry mechanisms well-defined

## No Critical Issues Found
The story is well-prepared and ready for developer implementation once Stories 1.3, 2.1, and 2.2 are complete.
