# Detailed Story Breakdown

## Story 1-1: Project Initialization & Monorepo Setup

**Story ID**: Story 1-1  
**Branch**: feature/story-1-1  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Parallel-safe**: true  
**Module/area**: Root monorepo structure, package management

**Story**:
**As a** developer,
**I want** to initialize the project within a monorepo structure,
**so that** I can efficiently manage the frontend and backend codebases in a single repository.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. A Git repository is created and configured.
2. A monorepo management tool (e.g., Turborepo) is set up at the root of the project.
3. Initial application folders for `frontend` (React/Vite) and `backend` (FastAPI) are created within the monorepo.
4. A shared package is created within the monorepo to hold common TypeScript types that will be used by both the frontend and backend.

## Story 1-2: Backend Google OAuth 2.0 Flow

**Story ID**: Story 1-2  
**Branch**: feature/story-1-2  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Parallel-safe**: true  
**Module/area**: Backend authentication, OAuth endpoints

**Story**:
**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement the server-side Google OAuth 2.0 authentication flow,
**so that** the application can securely obtain permission to access a user's Google Calendar.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The backend provides an endpoint that initiates the OAuth flow by redirecting the user to the Google OAuth 2.0 consent screen.
2. The backend correctly handles the callback from Google, exchanging the received authorization code for an access token and a refresh token.
3. The refresh token is securely stored in a designated secret manager (e.g., Google Cloud Secret Manager).
4. Upon successful authentication, a secure session (e.g., using an HTTP-only cookie) is created for the user to maintain their logged-in state.

## Story 1-3: Frontend Login Interface

**Story ID**: Story 1-3  
**Branch**: feature/story-1-3  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Parallel-safe**: true  
**Module/area**: Frontend authentication UI, login components

**Story**:
**As a** user,
**I want** to see a clean login page with a "Login with Google" button,
**so that** I can easily and securely initiate the authentication process.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. A login page is created in the React application that serves as the entry point for unauthenticated users.
2. The page displays a prominent "Login with Google" button, styled using the Material-UI component library.
3. Clicking the button directs the user to the backend's OAuth initiation endpoint.
4. After a successful login and redirection from the backend, the user is navigated to a simple, placeholder "main application" page.

## Story 2: Backend Calendar API Endpoint

**Story ID**: Story 2  
**Branch**: feature/story-2  
**Dependencies**: Stories 1-1, 1-2  
**Parallel-safe**: false  
**Module/area**: Backend API, Google Calendar integration

**Story**:
**As a** developer,
**I want** to create a secure backend endpoint that retrieves calendar events using the Google Calendar API,
**so that** the frontend has a data source to display the user's calendar.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. A new, protected backend endpoint (e.g., `/api/calendar/events`) is created that requires an active user session.
2. The endpoint retrieves the user's stored refresh token from the secret manager to obtain a fresh access token for the Google API.
3. The endpoint successfully calls the Google Calendar API to fetch events for a relevant time period (e.g., the upcoming 7 days).
4. The fetched events are returned to the client in a structured, easy-to-use JSON format.

## Story 3: Frontend Main Application Layout

**Story ID**: Story 3  
**Branch**: feature/story-3  
**Dependencies**: Stories 1-1, 1-3  
**Parallel-safe**: false  
**Module/area**: Frontend layout, responsive design

**Story**:
**As a** user,
**I want** to see a well-structured main application screen with both a calendar view and a chat interface,
**so that** I can easily understand and interact with the application's core features.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. The placeholder main application page is replaced with a two-column layout using Material-UI's grid system.
2. The left column is clearly designated for the calendar view.
3. The right column is clearly designated for the chat interface.
4. The layout is fully responsive, stacking the two columns vertically on smaller (mobile/tablet) screens.

## Git Worktree Commands

### Setup worktrees for parallel development:
```bash
# Create worktrees for parallel stories
git worktree add -b feature/story-1-1 ../story-1-1 main
git worktree add -b feature/story-1-2 ../story-1-2 main
git worktree add -b feature/story-1-3 ../story-1-3 main

# After parallel stories complete, create sequential worktrees
git worktree add -b feature/story-2 ../story-2 main
git worktree add -b feature/story-3 ../story-3 main
```

### Merge strategy:
1. Complete all parallel stories (1-1, 1-2, 1-3)
2. Merge them into main branch
3. Create sequential worktrees from updated main
4. Complete Story 2, merge to main
5. Complete Story 3, merge to main
